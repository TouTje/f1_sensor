## What is F1 Sensor?

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that creates sensors using data from the [Jolpica-F1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1). It is designed for users who want to build automations, scripts, notifications, TTS messages, or more advanced use cases such as generating dynamic dashboards, triggering race-day routines, syncing events to calendars, or integrating with external services based on upcoming Formula 1 events.

> [!TIP]
> If your goal is to visually display upcoming race information, current standings, and more in your Home Assistant dashboard, the [FormulaOne Card](https://github.com/marcokreeft87/formulaone-card) is the better choice for that purpose.

This integration **does not provide any UI components**. Instead, it creates:
- `sensor.f1_next_race` — Attributes include detailed information about the next race, such as when and where it takes place.
- `sensor.f1_season_calendar` — A list of all races in the current F1 season.
- `sensor.f1_driver_standings` — Current driver championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_constructor_standings` — Current constructor championship standings.
- `sensor.f1_weather`: Current weather and race-time forecast at the next race location.
- `sensor.f1_latest_race_results`: Results from the most recent Formula 1 race. *(new)*
- `sensor.f1_season_results`: All race results for the ongoing season. *(new)*

During installation, you can choose exactly which sensors you want to include in your setup.  
This gives you control over which data points to load — for example, only the next race and weather, without standings or calendar.

You can always change this selection later by reconfiguring the integration via **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.

The integration fetches fresh data from the Jolpica-F1 API every 1 hours.

I personally use this integration to display the next race and the following three races on an e-ink display. You can read more about that setup [here](https://github.com/Nicxe/esphome).

### Known Issue

`sensor.f1_season_results` may trigger a warning in the Home Assistant logs:

```yaml
Logger: homeassistant.components.recorder.db_schema
Source: components/recorder/db_schema.py:663
Integration: Recorder
State attributes for sensor.f1_season_results exceed maximum size of 16384 bytes. This can cause database performance issues; Attributes will not be stored
```

Despite the warning, the sensor should still work fine for display in the frontend. However, to avoid any database load/performance issues, it is recommended to **exclude this sensor from being recorded** in your `recorder:` config:

```yaml
recorder:
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.f1_season_results
```

## Installation

You can install this integration as a custom repository by following one of these guides:

### With HACS (Recommended)

To install the custom component using HACS:

1. Click on the three dots in the top right corner of the HACS overview menu.
2. Select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the repository URL: `https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor`.
4. Select type: **Integration**.
5. Click the **ADD** button.

<details>
<summary>Without HACS</summary>

1. Download the latest release of the F1 Sensor integration from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor/releases)**.
2. Extract the downloaded files and place the `f1_sensor` folder in your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory (usually located in the `config/custom_components` directory).
3. Restart your Home Assistant instance to load the new integration.

## Configuration

To add the integration to your Home Assistant instance, use the button below:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=f1_sensor)

### Manual Configuration

If the button above does not work, you can also perform the following steps manually:

1. Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
2. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services**.
3. In the bottom right corner, select the **Add Integration** button.
4. From the list, select **F1 Sensor**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

## Example

### Example Screenshots

This [e-ink display project](https://github.com/Nicxe/esphome) uses the sensors from this integration to show upcoming Formula 1 races, including race countdown and schedule.

### Example: Announce next race and top standings via TTS

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
  message: >
    {% set next_race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set race_date = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start')) %}
    {% set race_location = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set race_country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set days_left = (race_date.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}
    The next Formula 1 race is the {{ next_race }} in {{ race_location }}, {{ race_country }}, happening in {{ days_left }} day{{ 's' if days_left != 1 else '' }}.
    The top 3 drivers right now are:
    Number 1: {{ drivers[0].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ drivers[1].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ drivers[2].Driver.givenName }} {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} with {{ drivers[2].points }} points.
    In the constructor standings:
    Number 1: {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[0].points }} points.
    Number 2: {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[1].points }} points.
    Number 3: {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} with {{ constructors[2].points }} points.
```

### Example: Mobile notification with race info and standings

```yaml
service: notify.mobile_app_yourdevice
data:
  title: "🏁 Formula 1 Update"
  message: >
    {% set race = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_name') %}
    {% set city = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_locality') %}
    {% set country = state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'circuit_country') %}
    {% set race_time = as_datetime(state_attr('sensor.f1_next_race', 'race_start')) %}
    {% set days = (race_time.date() - now().date()).days %}
    {% set drivers = state_attr('sensor.f1_driver_standings', 'driver_standings') %}
    {% set constructors = state_attr('sensor.f1_constructor_standings', 'constructor_standings') %}
    Next race: {{ race }} in {{ city }}, {{ country }} — in {{ days }} day{{ 's' if days != 1 else '' }}.
    Top drivers:
    1. {{ drivers[0].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ drivers[1].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ drivers[2].Driver.familyName }} ({{ drivers[2].points }} pts)
    Top constructors:
    1. {{ constructors[0].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[0].points }} pts)
    2. {{ constructors[1].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[1].points }} pts)
    3. {{ constructors[2].Constructor.name }} ({{ constructors[2].points }} pts)
```

> [!NOTE]  
> ### Support the API that makes this possible  
> This integration relies entirely on the amazing [Jolpica-F1 API](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1), which provides high-quality and up-to-date Formula 1 data for free.  
> If you find this integration useful, please consider supporting the creator of the API by donating to their Ko-fi page: [https://ko-fi.com/jolpic](https://ko-fi.com/jolpic)  
> Without this API, this integration would not be possible, so any support helps keep it live and maintained. 🙏
